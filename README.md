# Svelte Health Metrics Frontend

A slick Svelte interface for my Go & SQLite3 health tracking backend.

## Purpose

This project implements a responsive Svelte frontend to interact with my Go and SQLite3-powerd backend CRUD operations. It aims to provide a seamless user experience for recording and retrieving health metrics such as step counts and sleep duration.

## Current Focus

The initial phase concentrates on enabling users to log and fetch step count data through an intuitive Svelte interface.
